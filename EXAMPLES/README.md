## Examples for `reason-apollo-client`

Here you'll find pretty sparse example of a fully functioning app and basic usage. It leverages a lightweight [example graphql server](https://github.com/zth/graphql-client-example-server) and webpack to serve app assets.

#### Trying it out locally

```sh
yarn

yarn start
# (in another tab) Run the development server
yarn dev-server
# (in yet another tab!) Run the example GraphQL server
yarn graphql-server
```
